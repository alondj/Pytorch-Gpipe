#TODO notes about partition and profiling API
0. add check that the model was actually partitioned according to plan
2. warn if model cannot be partioned at all
3. make nice error codes
4. add more config options
5. add documentation
6. add static typing


#TODO notes about pipeline API
0. make nice error codes
1. add documentation
2. add static typing
3. optimize like there is no tommorow


#TODO provided functionality:
1a. model profiling +
2a. model visualization(no profiler)+
2b. model visualization (using profiler)+
2c. model visualization (using custom weights)+
3a. model partition using our Graph +
3b. model partition using our Graph and custom weights/weighting function +
4a. model distibution using our Graph + (still need to write the pipeline wrapper) +-
5b. model distribution without our Graph given: - ? still need to decide what is required
    1. scope to device mapping 
    2. buffers and parameters to device mapping if they are not part of said scopes
    2. scope output shapes without the batch dim
    3. partition input scopes(a subset of 1)
    4. model input shape (for each scope of 1)
    5. ?
