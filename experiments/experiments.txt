#TODO experiments


performence:
    1. compare memory consumption between the pipeline and dataPatallel/singleGpu/naiveModelParallel
    2. for a given network partition and a given batch size find optimal microbatch size
    3. for a given network partition find optimal batch size (microbatch size is batch/nparts)

effects of partition on performence:
    1. for a given network find effects of depth and basic blocks on performence
    2. for a given network find effects of number of partition

reproduce paper results:
    1. resnet 101
    2. AmoebaNet-D https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/e5c126d66aa3d25e0cb066bdf7fc46f98fe59901/models/experimental/amoeba_net
